Players can freely decide:
<br />
<br />
• Wether to be tracked or not
<br />
• Turning on/off GUI
<br />
• GUI type
<br />
• Icon Color
<br />
<br />


Say hello to the Player Locator!
<br />

This item seamlessly integrates the Player Locator GUI feature into gameplay. Customization and control is all intuitively done in game, rather than behind menus or with yet another gamerule.
